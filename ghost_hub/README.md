<ins>Motivation</ins>

After looking at "It must be the hantu" Facebook page, there are actually many Singaporeans who have their paranormal stories to tell.

About some years ago, a new hobby emerged. It is called urban exploration (UrbEx), where people explore abandoned locations so that they get a view of how it was like back in the days. It may not necessarily be a paranormal investigation but there some reports of UrbEx explorers who made contact with the unseen. 

There are some paranormal investigators who would go to the extreme by going into haunted places alone, so they need to capture all images as evidence.

 This project aims to be a main base for people to share their paranormal encounters 
 and for paranormal research and references. The whole idea is inspired from the SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) Foundation, a fictional foundation where people share details of anomalous creatures online and classify each of them according to its characteristics. For example: SCP-457 (Burning Man) (https://vocal.media/horror/10-dangerous-sc-ps-that-must-never-escape-part-2)
